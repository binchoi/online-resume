  Hi, my name is Bin Choi. I'm a junior backend developer and a third-year student at Yale-NUS College. I am currently studying Computer Science at Aalto University in Finland as an exchange student.

  I enjoy logical problem solving and am deeply fascinated by the intersection of Medicine and Computer Science. Working with <mark>Spring Boot</mark> has taught me the importance of a well-structured MVC framework and Test-Driven Development. I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The languages that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Scala</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>OCaml</mark>, and <mark>Bash/Linux</mark>.

  The idea of being able to create new services that positively impact countless lives is the driving force behind my back-end development journey.

          Become a Habit Racer and fill two needs with one deed
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This is an application that developed from my own needs. Whether it be practicing for coding interviews or exercising regularly, I found habit building to be an incredibly difficult and lonely journey. To transform this uphill battle into an immersive and interactive recreation, I created HabitRacer - a competitve habit tracker that allows users to compete with their friends and family members over user-selected wagers while building new habits together. Users create/join races and record their daily success whenever they successfully keep to their habit; the user that recorded more successes at the end of the race is crowned champion and claims the wager. For each race, the service provides race statistics and visualizes the progress of each driver on a race track to keep up the user's motivation!
          
          I encountered many new tools and developed new and existing skills in the process of building this project. These include <mark>Spring Boot</mark>, <mark>AWS</mark> (i.e. EC2, S3, CodeDeploy), <mark>MariaDB</mark>, <mark>JUnit</mark>, <mark>GitHub Actions</mark>, <mark>Spring Data JPA</mark>, and <mark>Java</mark>. I also experienced the importance of Test-Driven Development, RESTful APIs, and software quality management.

          My small contribution to the improvement of cancer research
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Computer algorithms are heavily relied upon in cancer research, especially in in-vivo studies (e.g. Patient Derived Xenografts). Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art algorithms and tools don't work as well as they should. My research focused on analyzing the performance of these popular tools and developing an original pipeline that implements an Expectation-Maximization algorithm from an Empirical Bayesian perspective with <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, and <mark>Bash</mark>.
